      <description>For Emacs users, optimizing their configuration is a fun thing, and it is also the best way to learn Emacs. Newbies are suggested to copy/paste configuration, which is the fastest and most effective way to learn.

      <description>About  Hi, I&amp;#39;m Jiacai Liu, a developer from Hangzhou, China.
 I have written blog since 2014, but in Chinese. In IT fields, it&amp;#39;s no doubt English is the most widely used language, so I decide I should write in English after having been working for 6 years.
 This blog will talk about programming languages, databases, web development and Emacs.

      <description>When it comes to Emacs, every programmer should have heard its name more or less. After all, Emacs has nearly forty years of history. However, many users abandon Emacs before comfort with it due to the steep learning curve. I understand their frustration, I also made many attempts before &amp;#34;skilled&amp;#34; in Emacs.
 After spend honey moon with Emacs for four years, I think I can share what I learn from Emacs and shed some light for newcomers.</description>
