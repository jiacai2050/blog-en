* About
Hi, I'm Jiacai Liu, a developer from Hangzhou, China.

I have written blog since 2014, but [[https://liujiacai.net/][in Chinese]]. In IT fields, it's no doubt English is the most widely used language, so I decide I should write in English after having been working for 6 years.

This blog will talk about programming languages, databases, web development and Emacs.

If you have any questions you can reach me via [[mailto:jiacai2050+blog@gmail.com][email]].
